# scoop-charmbracelet

A [Scoop](http://scoop.sh) bucket of useful [charmbracelet](https://github.com/charmbracelet/) utilities.

To make it easy to install apps from this bucket, run:

```
scoop bucket add charmbracelet https://github.com/developing-today-forks/scoop-charmbracelet
```

## Why does this exist?

For an app to be acceptable for the main bucket, it should be:

* open source
* a command-line program
* the latest stable version of the program
* reasonably well-known and widely used

The "extras" bucket has more relaxed requirements, so it's a good place to put anything that doesn't quite fit in the main bucket.

The "charmbracelet" bucket is specifically for the many utilities found on the charmbracelet website which haven't made it into the main bucket, _yet_.
